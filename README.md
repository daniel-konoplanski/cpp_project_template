# cpp_project_template

A clean, practical starter for modern C++ projects — ready-to-build, well-configured tooling, and sensible defaults so you can focus on code instead of setup.

## What’s included
- MIT license (editable) — permissive, friendly for open source and commercial use.
- CMakePresets for x86_64 Linux (GCC and Clang) with ready-to-use presets for Debug/Release and shared-package layouts.
- vcpkg integration support so you can add third-party libraries cleanly.
- Editor/linting configs:
  - .clangd — language server config for accurate code navigation.
  - .clang-format — consistent formatting rules.
  - clang-tidy config — basic static-analysis hooks.
- Well-thought build directory layout and helper targets so builds for different compilers and build types stay isolated.
